        <h1>Who is BLU?</h1>
        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>Professionally, my name is Brandon Lu. My peers call me BLU based on my initials "BLu".
            I am naturally a very introverted person at heart.
            Because of this, it was very hard for me to make friends prior to high school.
            I was the type to conform to the social norms, to do everything that I thought society wanted me to do.
            I just wanted people to like me. 
        </p>
		<h3>Elementary School</h3>
		<p>This was my first journey in life. I grew up in Huntsville, Alabama. Everything was fine. I had friends.
            Nobody discriminated against each other. We saw each other as equals.
            We all knew each other and could comfortably talk to anyone in our entire grade.</p>
		<h3>Middle School</h3>
		<p>Middle school was the start of a miserable life for me.
            I had a few friends, but we were all immature.
            I tried to be a social person, but it isn't as easy at is seems.
            Middle school is the point in my life in which I learned about discrimination.
            Being one of the only few Asians in a predominantly white and black school made me an easy target for bullying.
            It didn't help that I was short, skinny, unathletic, not the best student, or have any talents.
            Add to that the level of immaturity of my peers, it was brutal.
        </p>
        <p>The bullying ranged from verbal, to physical, to emotional.
            Some kids would constantly racially harass me in the hallway.
            Some would push or smack me around knowing that I wouldn't do anything about it.
            Three kids in my class decided to publicly post to my facebook wall that I should kill myself for being Asian.
            I deleted the multiple posts of this content that they tried to upload.
            The next day in class, they told me that they were just joking.
            I told them it was fine, but I didn't tell them that I actually did contemplate taking my own life that day.
            I would go to adults, but it never helped.
            </p>
        <p>Adults who cared would call these bullies into their offices to talk to them, but that would never last.
            Some adults didn't care at all.
            One day in my Home Economics class, I told me peers that it was racist to always refer to me as "Asian" rather than my real name.
            My teacher, overhearing the conversation, told me that it wasn't racist to call someone Asian.
            I guess she just didn't care about the context.
        </p>
		<h3>Starting Fresh</h3>
		<p>By the end of my 7th grade year, I had had enough.
            I was depressed. I was suicidal.
            At this point, I was thinking about taking my own life every single day.
            One day, I sat in front of my laptop in tears as I wrote a letter explaining why I couldn't take this life anymore.
            I had looked up the most painless ways to end your own life.
            Why didn't I ever end up acting on it?
        </p>
        <p>I didn't mention before, but I am not religious at all.
            As a kid, I always wanted to identify as a Christian because everyone else in the community did.
            As I grew up, I found it harder and harder to believe in the god that Christianity described.
            Eventually I accepted agnosticism.
            I didn't believe in any god or prophet that any major world religion believed in,
            but I did believe in some, I guess you could say "generic", higher power.
            Why does this all matter?
            Even though I didn't believe in God or Christianity as a whole, I was afraid of going to hell.
            Eventually I thought I had found a way to potentially end this mental suffering.
        </p>
        <h3>Moving to Georgia</h3>
        <p>My oldest cousin Sean was attending the Georgia Institute of Technology around this time.
            This was one of the best universities in the nation for engineering.
            I already had an interest in programming and thtought that it would be a good career path.
            I asked my father to let me move to Georgia with the goal of getting accepted into Georgia Tech after high school.
            This was not a complete lie, but it was not the primary motive for moving.
            I wanted to move to escape the miserable life I had in Alabama.
            He agreed to let me live with his closest cousin's family in Duluth.
            In the fall of 2011, I had officially moved away from my parents to live with my uncle's family.
        </p>
        <h4>It wasn't an instant solution to my depression</h4>
        <p>My first week as a freshman was rough.
            I was a new person in a new school in a new city in a new state.
            I didn't know anybody.
            I didn't have any friends.
            Again, being the introverted person I was back then, It wasn't easy for me to initiate converstaion.
            I remember sitting at a table with two girls in class before lunch.
            I thought to myself, "Alright Brandon. This is your last chance to make a friend before lunch. Otherwise you'll be sitting alone."
            I finally worked up the nerve to open my mouth and speak.
        </p>
        <p>"So did you both go to Duluth Middle School?"
            <br>
            "Yes"
            <br>
            "So I imagine you two have been friends for a while?"
            <br>
            "Yea"
            <br>
            *Awkward silence*
            <br>
            I guess I'm having lunch alone today...
        </p>
        <p>I eventually made some acquaintences.
            I remember when I got invited to my first party.
            I had never been invited to a party before in my life.
            I was excited.
            I finally felt like a human being.
            But still something wasn't quite right.
            I was still missing something.
            Something that made me feel incomplete.
        </p>
        <h1>The Cruise</h1>
        <p>If I had to choose the point in my life when things started to change dramatically, it would be the summer after my freshman year.
            My family took me on a week long cruise to the Bahamas.
            There was a club called "Club O<sub>2</sub>" only accessible to teenagers ages 15-17.
        </p>
        <p>I sat in the corner watching everyone have fun.
            This random girl came up to me asking if I wanted to dance.
            Today this would have blown my mind since it is so rare for women at my current age to initiate an interaction like this.
            But that night, I was still extremely introverted and socially awkward.
            I told her I couldn't dance, and she left to have fun with her friends.
            That's when a group of guys my age approached me.
            One of them, obviously the ring leader, stepped up, grabbed my hand, and pulled me up to dance with them.
            It was such a rush of adrenaline and I loved it.
            I ended up spending the rest of the week with these guys.
        </p>
        <p>This was one of the best weeks of my life.
            I boarded that cruise as an extremely introverted person who couldn't approach a stranger without having an anxiety attack.
            I left the cruise ready to meet so many more people.
            From that day, I became much more outgoing and social.
        </p>
        <h1>The Girl</h1>
        <p>What life story doesn't include a young love interest?
            I had no experience with girls prior to high scool.
            I had a lot of girlfriends throughout middle school, but back then, people didn't date out of attraction.
            We dated just for the sake of saying we had a partner.
            I had never kissed any of them.
            I never even held their hands.
            The most I had ever gotten from a girl was a hug.
            Other than that, my dating life was non-existent.
        </p>
        <p>Enter the first love I ever had.
            I actually met her before the cruise during my freshman year.
            I remember sitting in front of her in my English class.
            I thought she was cute and wanted to meet her.
            Our teacher was calling role. When she got to her name, I turned around and said hi.
            Every day I would say hi to her until we started conversing.
            Those conversations turned into a friendship and she started inviting me to her activities and events.
        </p>
        <p>Over time, our we got closer and closer, and the closer we got, the more I fell for her.
            But back then, I was still a coward.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would always put myself in a depressive mood and complained to my friends about not having her as my girlfriend.
            But what was the biggest problem with that?
            I never actually made a move on her.
            I was constantly complaining about not having a girl who I never went after in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            She had dated a couple of guys while we were friends.
            Being such close friends, I had to constantly listen to the girl I loved talk about the guys she was with.
            Eventually I fell into depression again.
            I know what you're thinking.
            <br>
            "You were depressed because as a 15 year old over a crush?"
            <br>
            All I can say is that it is what it is.
            But believe it or not, this depression was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
            This depression drove me to start a journey pursuing success and greatness.
        </p>
        <p>Because of my situation, I thought that my problems would go away if I could just get a girlfriend.
            So what did I do? I started researching "How to meet women".
            I went through link after link until I found something that would change my life.
        </p>
        <h1>Simple Pickup</h1>
        <p>I eventually stumbled upon a YouTube channel Called "Simple Pickup".
            This was a channel that was dedicated to helping people improve their social skills, mainly in the area of dating.
            Each video covered a different area of social dynamics.
            After watching every single video, I finally worked the nerve to put it into practice.
        </p>
        <p>I remember the first time I ever approached a girl in public.
            I told her I found her attractive and wanted to meet her.
            She was so flattered as a huge smile appeared on her face.
            We introduced ourselves and shook hands.
            Since this was the first time I had ever done this, my mind went completely blank.
            I dropped her hand and walked away without a word.
            The confusion in her face was pretty comical, but that aside, you won't always make your first shot.
            This was the start of my active pickup journey.
        </p>
        <p> The more I practiced, the better I got.
            After a month of going out every weekend to meet new people, I could confidently approach stranger without hesitation.
            Although everyone in highschool knew me as "Brandon", I started going by "BLU" to the people I'd meet while going out.
            My dating life was soaring at this point.
            I went from the most awkward person in the world to getting a new date every weekend.
            During my Junior year, I even went exclusive with a nice woman I met at the mall, although we broke up after about 6 months of dating.
        </p>
        <h2>Back to the Girl</h2>
        <p>As I honed my skills as a pickup artist, I eventually developed the confidence to ask the I fell for throughout highschool out.
            It went so much rougher than I expected. I expected simply a yes or no, but she actually got upset with me.
            Eventually we talked things out and she told me she wasn't interested but she'd keep an open mind.
            What I didn't know at the time was that she would never be intersted in me.
            She was just afraid of losing me as a friend, so eventually I toook the pressure off of her and decided to stop pursuing her.
            But as my success with other girls grew, she seemed to get more and more judgemental.
            She would start criticizing little things about me more and more often to the point where I resented talking to her.
            Eventually, I decided to cut her out of my life which was one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make, but it was the right decision.
            I felt that my love and care for her and how she felt was constantly holding me back in life, and I neede to break free from those shackles.
        </p>
        <h2>Pickup Post Graduation</h2>
        <p>Once I graduated high school, I realized that pickup was not just about dating, it was about life as a whole.
            Learning how to talk to women taught me how to talk to people in general whether it were flirtatious, platonic, or professional.
            Once I graduated, these skills helped me get a much better job than my previous job at McDonalds.
            The social skills that I had acquired as a pickup artist made me successful in sales and advertising.
            This allowed me to travel the country with my boss to promote his products about two years after I started working for him.
            These skills also helped me build connections for any reason whatsoever.
        </p>
        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>The summer after I graduated and before I got promoted to sales and advertising, I was just a simple office assistant.
            Because I was working so much, I was too exhausted to go out as much as I used to which crippled my social skills since I was out of practice.
            Towards the end of the summer, I noticed that I still had the confidence to approach strangers, but I didn't know how get their attration.
            Once college started, I decided to introduce myself to everyone I met as "BLU" and left "Brandon" behind.
            I started practicing my social skills again on campus until I reached the peak of my pickup journey at the time.
            I had never had so much success meeting and attracting new people before.
            Above all, pickup taught me that everyone has their own story, their own struggles, and that taught me to treat everyone I met with respect.
            I eventually made my closest friends through pickup.
            This journey paved a path of success for me.
        </p>
        <h1>Enough About Pickup, Let's Talk About School</h1>
        <p>I was so much happier with this lifestyle, but believe it or not, I was still depressed.
            I always ignored it because at the time, I had no idea what I could possibly be depressed about.
            I had a great job, I had great friends, and starting my Sophomore year of college, I even had a girlfriend.
            What could I possibly have to be depressed about?
            I can't answer that. All I can tell you is that to the rest of the world, I was the vibrant, free spirit trying to make the most out of my life.
            But behind closed doors, I would constantly get these somewhat pulsating waves of sadness.
            Sometimes I would cry and I would have no idea why.
            But I thought that I could just push it aside and continue to pursue my dreams.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, I couldn't ignore my depression anymore.
            It was affecting my personality.
            It was affecting how I treated others.
            It was affecting my grades.
            It was affecting how I just generally handled things.
        </p>
        <p>After the second semester of my Junior year of college, my girlfriend motivated me to open up about things.
            I did. I opened up to my brother. He helped me create a plan to get my grades back up.
            They both constantly motivated me to do better and supported me throughout my struggles.
            It was a huge struggle.
        </p>
            My spring semester of 2018 was the most stressful one I had ever had to endure.
            But at the end, it was all worth it. For the first time in my college career, I got nearly straight A's.
            I ended the semester with a 3.81 and was named to the Dean's List.
            All of my friends were so proud of me, and I was so proud of myself.
            I ended up taking time off work so that I could focus on my programming skills.
        </p>
        <h1>Where Am I Now?</h1>
        <p>Now, my focus is 110% on expanding my programming skills.
            I began this summer only able to code in Java.
            Even then, I did not know how to use Java to create an actual application.
            I could only program simple things that would run on a console.
        </p>
        <p> Now, I am familiar with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
            I plan to work on different projects, one by one, to further expand these skills.
            Hopefully these skills will get me professional employment as a software developer once I graduate from college.
